# Building different GANs in Jupyter Notebook
This repository contains different kind of  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) implementations using Keras in Jupyter Notebook

# Regular GAN
Just the regular GAN as introduced by [Goodfellow at. al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661). 

# GAN with label information
An extension in which class label information is taken into account. In contrast to the conventional GAN, this allows to decide which class to generated. These GANs were introduce by [Salimans et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498).
