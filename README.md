# Building different GANs in Jupyter Notebook
This repository contains different kind of  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) implementations using Keras in Jupyter Notebook

# [Regular GAN](GAN-MNIST.ipynb)
Just the regular GAN as introduced by [Goodfellow at. al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661). 

# [Conditional GAN](Conditional-GAN-MNIST.ipynb)
An extension in which class label information is taken into account. In contrast to the conventional GAN, this allows you to decide which class is to be generated. Conditional GANs were introduce by [Mirza & Osindero](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1784).
